This project started as a module for the ACE Framework to track and evaluate activity in ACE-adopted domains.  The original intention was to filter out non-human interactions when loading tools and UI modules, as well as to provide a convenient record of interaction patterns to have available when users wanted to flag negative experiences.

As we talked to potential adopters, it became clear that having a better understanding of how users were interacting with server content is a huge unfulfilled need.  Because our module already does this, and in real-time with actionable pattern analysis built into it, it was obvious that this could be a product that many would have interest in.
